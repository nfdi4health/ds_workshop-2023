# DataSHIELD Workshop 2023 
## Introduction
Due to varying degrees of informed consent from study participants and limitations originating from regulations and data privacy laws, sharing study datasets has been a great concern for many institutes that otherwise would like to collaborate in order to fully utilise the strength of their combined collected data. Hence, within the NFDI4Health framework, one aim is to enable institutes to participate in such research projects without actually ceding control over their data. 

DataSHIELD[1] is a software solution for secure data analysis of personal health data in the programming language R, in which data holders can keep their data behind a firewall on dedicated servers (Opal Servers) while researchers can remotely analyse data under tight control, send analyses requests and receive summary statistics back.

## How does DataSHIELD work?
Analysis requests are sent from a central analysis machine to several data-holding machine storing the harmonised data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel, linked by non-disclosive summary statistics. Analysis is taken to the data â€“ not the data to the analysis.
